## Lessons Learned

- This project was a massive undertaking! I learned the importance of planning, prioritizing and timeboxing, especially when it comes to utilizing/experimenting with third party libraries. I lost a lot of time trying to figure out how to use glidejs! This project illuminated the importance of breaking iterations down into smaller, more digestible pieces, and focusing on JUST one piece at a time. I found myself starting one task but then worrying 7 steps ahead about what might come after, rather than just focusing on the task at hand and making progress there.
- Connecting to the DOM is hard, but it is so rewarding to see once it DOES display what/how you want! Taking time to make sure you really understand the data and how it is structured will greatly help in the long run. Creating the login page took me A LOT longer than I thought it would, but I eventually got there!
